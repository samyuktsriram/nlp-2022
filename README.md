# nlp-2022

This repository contains 3 parts:

1. The ExampleImplementations contains jupyter notebooks for various NLP related tasks, like translation, sentiment analysis, etc. These are practice implementations that I wrote to learn and implement some of the most common applications of NLP. Each file has links to reference material / datasets used.

2. The LiteratureReview (WIP) folder contains a draft of my literature review on the task of Unsupervised Style Transfer for Text using Non-Parallel Data. This document is pending review / editing, and is very rough. Any feedback would be appreciated!

3. The Finance_Sentiment_Analysis (WIP) folder contains a few things:
    1. A jupyter notebook to train a classifier in the domain of finance news sentiment analysis
    2. A jupyter notebook that applies this classifier on a specific dataset to create new datapoints
    3. A zip file containing all the datasets used and generated from the above 2 files.
